# breastcancer_predictor

Breast cancer is cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.
Due to many complexities from a biological perspective, often it takes time for the doctors to go through every report, which makes room for a human error. This might well result in death of the patient in case of False Negative or removal of the concerned part in case of False Positive.

To ensure a negligible margin of error, i have created a Breast Cancer Predictor which as the name states predicts whether a patient,s cells are Malignant(+ve) or Benign(-ve)
